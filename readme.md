## Description
This was the final project as part of a Udemy course - [The Complete JavaScript Course 2020](https://www.udemy.com/the-complete-javascript-course/).
Forkify is a recipe finding web application which uses data from the [Forkify](http://forkify-api.herokuapp.com/) API. While it is a fairly basic web application, it can be used as a guide to cook one's favorite dish. Beyond accessing recipes from different sources online, it also provides information on the number and amount of ingredients needed to build a specific dish according to the number of people to serve.
This project was my first real delve into JavaScript and Web Development. 


## Installation

```bash
git clone https://github.com/tanviroy/forkify.git

npm run start
```

## Limitations
* There are only a limited number of queries that can be searched for - [Possible searches](http://forkify-api.herokuapp.com/phrases.html) 
* The "Liked Recipes" feature has not been implemented yet.
* The overall functionality of this web app is basic and can be made more efficient to create a real world product. 

## Key Learnings

* A glimpse into what Web Development looks like 
* Working with Web Dev tools such as Webpack, Babel, etc. 
* Being comfortable with the Windows Command Prompt and Node Package Manager. 
* Learning how to debug *patiently*
* Making code readable and documentation



## Acknowledgments
I would like to thank Jonas Schmedtmann (@jonasschmedtmann) for his highly extensive, educational and practical JavaScript Course which taught me more JS than I could have imagined, all from scratch. Deeply enjoyed this course.
